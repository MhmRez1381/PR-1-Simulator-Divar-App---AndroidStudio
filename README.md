# Divar App Home Page Simulator

## Description
This project is an Android application built with Android Studio that simulates the home page of the Divar app, a popular classified ads platform in Iran. It replicates the main interface where users can browse categories like real estate, cars, mobiles, and sports equipment. The app was developed in an older version of Android Studio, so compatibility might require updates.

Note: The exact design details are based on a general recollection; actual screenshots or runs may vary.

## Features
- **Main Screen**: A simple layout with buttons or icons for major categories.
- **Category Pages**: Dedicated activities for:
  - Real Estate (Amlak)
  - Cars
  - Mobiles
  - Sports
- Basic navigation between the home page and category views.

## Technologies Used
- Android Studio
- Java (for activities like MainActivity, Amlak, Car, Mobile, Sport)
- XML for layouts (e.g., activity_main.xml, activity_amlak.xml, etc.)
- Gradle for build management

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in Android Studio (recommend using a compatible version; if issues arise, update Gradle and dependencies).
3. Build the project and run it on an emulator or physical device.

If you encounter version compatibility issues, try updating the build.gradle files or migrating to a newer Android Studio version.
